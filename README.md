A collection of code snippets and reference for interview-type programming questions

### Challenge 1: Arrays: Left Rotation
##### Implementation Language: Python
This challenge involved shifting elements of an array a certain number of times (k), based the array (a) and its length (n). This was done by removing the first element of the list and appending it to the end of the list (k) times. The final array (a) was then returned and printed on one line, with a space separating the elements.

### Challenge 2: Trees: Is This a Binary Search Tree?
##### Implementation Language: Python
This challenge involved Binary Search Trees (BST), and determining if a given BST (supplied from the computer) was in fact a BST or not. As this algorithm shows, the main determination factor for a BST is that, given an in-order traversal of its nodes, all data elements of those nodes are returned in strict ascending order, with no repeating data elements. The function that determines if the input is a BST returns true if it is, and false if not.
