### Challenge 1: Arrays: Left Rotation
##### Implementation Language: Python
This challenge involved shifting elements of an array a certain number of times (k), based the array (a) and its length (n). This was done by removing the first element of the list and appending it to the end of the list (k) times. The final array (a) was then returned and printed on one line, with a space separating the elements.
